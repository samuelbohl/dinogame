# Neuroevolution Dino Game (based on the Chrome Dino Game) 
Small javascript project to hack around with neuronal networks. I recreated a simpler version of the original Chrome Dino Game and then I modified it so that a simple neuroevolution algorithm solves it. (with the nn.js framework) 

The Neuroevolution part is based on the explanation in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6y21FkaUqw

Small remark: I made this project back in April 2019, so the code is not well structured nor well commented.
